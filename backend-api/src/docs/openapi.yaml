      summary: List staff members
      description: |
        Retrieves a list of staff members with optional pagination.
        
        **Pagination:**
        - Use `page` query parameter to specify the page number (default: 1)
        - Use `limit` query parameter to specify items per page (default: 10, max: 100)
        - If pagination parameters are not provided, returns all staff members (for backward compatibility)
        
        **Example:**
        - `/staff?page=1&limit=10` - Get first 10 staff members
        - `/staff?page=2&limit=20` - Get next 20 staff members (page 2)
        - `/staff` - Get all staff members (no pagination)

        **Rate Limiting & Account Lockout:**
        The system implements escalating account lockout to prevent brute-force attacks:
        - After **5 incorrect password attempts**, the account is locked for **5 minutes**
        - After the lockout expires, if **2 more incorrect attempts** occur, the account is locked for **10 minutes**
        - Each subsequent threshold (every 2 more incorrect attempts) doubles the lockout duration
        - Maximum lockout duration is capped at **30 minutes**
        - Failed attempts counter resets to 0 on successful login
        
        **Lockout Behavior:**
        - If an account is locked, login attempts will return a 429 error with the remaining lockout time
        - The lockout check happens before password verification
        - Successful login automatically resets the failed attempts counter and unlocks the account
